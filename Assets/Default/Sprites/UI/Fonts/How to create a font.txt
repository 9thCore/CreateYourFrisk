A CYF font is not that hard to create, you only have to know little tricks to make a new
font easily :P

If you haven't moved this file, you're actually in Default/Sprites/UI/Fonts/, so to create
a new font, you'll need to recreate that architecture on your mod: your font has to be 
located in YOURMOD/Sprites/UI/Fonts/ in order to work.

First of all, a font has two files: 
- A PNG file that stores the letters that you'll use for the font,
- A XML file that'll "map" the PNG file to know where the letters are.


The first step to create your own font is to put all your characters in a big png file.
I'd recommend you to put at least one pixel between the characters for more readability
and to order the characters: don't follow the examples here, all the letters are mixed up
and it's hard to decode it!
Don't forget that the letters have to be white and that the font will be transparent.
Plus, the font must have an even height, as the space between lines will be computed 
will be equal to the space's height x 1.5. 
Here is an example to show you what you should have. However, don't mind the back font, 
it's just here to see where the letters are:

When this will be done, you'll get into the real thing: the XML file. 
We'll first look at monster.xml's architecture:

That's a lot of things in here, the file seems to be always the same excepted the beginning.
If you don't know what XML is, I greatly recommend you to look at a tutorial about that.
You can do it without that, but knowing what you're about to do is always a good thing.

So, supposing that you have a minimum of knowledge in XML, we can see several nodes:
- <font> = It's the main XML node, every XML file needs one, don't change it.
- <voice> = Default voice used by the font. Overridden by the monster's voice and the 
[voice] text command. 
Default value: uifont for encounter fonts, monsterfont for monster fonts.
- <charspacing> = Pixels between each character, horizontally. Default value: 3
- <linespacing> = Pixels between each line, vertically.
Default value: The space's height x 1.5.
- <color> = Default color of the font. Must be set.
Default value: ffffff for encounter fonts, 000000 for monster fonts.
- <spritesheet> = This is where all your letters will be stored. Continue to see how to 
include letters into your XML!
- <sprite> = A letter value. You must set its name as the letter that you'll input.
Some characters can't be entered like this, so here are their "replacement" key:
    - '/' => "slash"
    - '.' => "dot"
    - '\' => "backslash"
    - ':' => "colon"
    - '?' => "questionmark"
    - '"' => "doublequote"
    - '*' => "asterisk"
    - ' ' => "space"
    - '<' => "lt"
    - '>' => "rt"
    - '&' => "ampersand"
I believe that some of them are not necessary. If you find some of these characters 
that can be used without this replacement key, please tell me so that I can update the 
tutorial!
- <rect> = The rectangle of the letter. Explications below.
- <border> = The shift of the letter. Explications below.


For each letter, you'll need to take the position in pixels of the bottom left 
corner of the letter from the bottom left corner of the image.
Look at the example link to see how you can map a "W":

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/122029647272607745/287685067755618304/unknown.png
Here, you can see that x = "22" and y = "62".

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/122029647272607745/287685428948107274/unknown.png
Here, w = "8" and "z" = "12".

So, the result of this data will lead to this:
    <sprite name="W">
        <rect x="22" y="62" w="8" h="12"/>
    </sprite>

However, for some letters like the "q", you'll need them to not be aligned with the other 
letters but to go a bit lower or upper...
To do this you can use <border>! Only use the x and y values of <border>, I wouldn't 
trust the other values if I were you :P

Be aware though! The coordinates are not used the same way as for sprites and all!
x => +x = right, -x = left
y => +y = DOWN, -y = UP 

After that, here is the code for the "q" of the monster font:
    <sprite name="q">
        <rect x="65" y="111" w="8" h="9"/>
        <border x="0" y="1" z="0" w="0"/>
    </sprite>


And all that you'll need to do is to do the same with all the other characters!
It's tedious, but at the end you'll have a brand new font to use for your own project :P
Enjoy! ^^
