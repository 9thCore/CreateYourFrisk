How to create an event on Unity with Tiled2Unity:

- Open your map
- First of all, an object called "perfab" has been done for the events, so you won't have to 
  worry about making the entire event. All that you have to do to load it is to go in 
  Assets/Ressources/Prefabs and then Click&Drag the prefab "Event1" in the GameObject list.
- Here is a list of the variables you'll need to modify in order to have a good event:
      - RectTransform ~ PosX/PosY: It's the position of the event.
      - RectTransform ~ Anchors: Anchor of the event. Set them at the same value!
      - RectTransform ~ Pivot: Pivot of the event. It changes the object's position!
      - SpriteRenderer ~ Sprite: It's not what will be used to display the sprite. 
                                 You can use it to see if the event looks good, though.
      - BoxCollider ~ Edit Collider Button: Permits you to modify the event's hitbox.
      - BoxCollider ~ Is Trigger: Must be activated for Touch events.
      - BoxCollider ~ Offset/Size: Same as the Edit Collider Button.
      - EventOW ~ Script To Load: Name of the event script to load when triggering this event
                                  The event must be in the directory MAPMOD/Lua/Events/
      - EventOW ~ Actual Page: The first page of the event (and in game the current page of 
                               the event)
      - EventOW ~ Event Triggers: This page MUST NOT be forgotten. Even if it doesn't seem to 
                                  be, it's the most important part of the event.
                                  In your event, you'll need to name all your functions 
                                  following the pattern "EventPage" + Page number.
                                  For each X value, you'll input the Page number, and for 
                                  their matching Y value you'll need to input the trigger 
                                  type of the event.
                                  0 = Confirm button, 1 = Touch the hitbox, 2 = Auto.
      - EventOW ~ Move Speed: The speed of the event in px/frame if you move the event.
      - AutoloadRessourcesFromRegistry ~ Sprite Path: Path of the sprite from MAPMOD/Sprites.

And then you'll need to create your event's script. It needs to be created at 
MADMOD/Lua/Events.

If you want to permanently disable an event, set its event page to -1. It'll be automatically 
deleted when you'll re-enter the map.

All the others must not be changed, unless you know what you're doing (excepted some 
self-explanatory values like SpriteRenderer ~ FlipX/FlipY)
