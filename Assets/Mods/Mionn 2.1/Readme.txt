o	About:

This is an encounter about an OC of ours with my wife. In the AU, Mionn is a half-human-monster hybrid, who came from the surface a few weeks before the protagonist, and has a significant impact on the events of the Underground. Her unique background gives her the unusual ability to produce and to some extent contain Determination. This is a mechanic within the fight. Whenever you attack or taunt her, she will gain some DET, and if she reaches a certain point, she will initiate a final attack, leading to the death of either her or the player. There are several ways to go about this fight. If you prefer, you can hack away, you can try and spare her, mock her to death or betray her if you so desire (you sick sick person).

o	DISCLAIMER:

The fight contains graphical content. Used discretion is advised. Possible spoilers ahead as well.
