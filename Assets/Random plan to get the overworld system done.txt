Plan d'attaque:

Launch event
No text, direct compilation
In a C# coroutine: (IEnumerator) 
    Launch compilation lua code in another coroutine (coroutine.create(), coroutine.resume())
	While the coroutine is running:
		Launch the event in map (Action/Func?) ???
	    "Stop" the lua coroutine (coroutine.yield())
		If needed, store the return value in another value
		"Relaunch" the lua coroutine (coroutine.resume())  ???
